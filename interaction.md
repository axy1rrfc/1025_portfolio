# Portfolio Website Interaction Design

## Core Interactive Components

### 1. 3D Hero Section with Dynamic Background
- **Primary Interaction**: Interactive 3D particle system using Three.js
- **User Experience**: Mouse movement creates ripple effects in 3D space, particles respond to cursor position
- **Visual Effect**: Floating geometric shapes with shader-based glow effects
- **Animation**: Continuous subtle rotation and floating motion with parallax scrolling

### 2. GitHub Project Showcase with Real-time Data
- **Primary Interaction**: Dynamic project grid with filtering and sorting capabilities
- **User Experience**: 
  - Filter by programming language, project type, or star count
  - Sort by recent activity, popularity, or creation date
  - Click project cards to expand with detailed information
- **Data Source**: GitHub API integration fetching user's public repositories
- **Visual Effect**: 3D card flip animations with project thumbnails and live stats

### 3. Interactive Skills Visualization
- **Primary Interaction**: 3D skill tree with hover effects and progress indicators
- **User Experience**: 
  - Hover over skill nodes to see proficiency levels and experience details
  - Click to expand related projects or certifications
  - Animated progress bars with smooth transitions
- **Visual Effect**: Network-style connections between skills with particle flow

### 4. Contact Form with 3D Elements
- **Primary Interaction**: Floating form elements with validation feedback
- **User Experience**: 
  - Form fields with 3D depth and shadow effects
  - Real-time validation with smooth error/success animations
  - Submit button with loading animation and success confirmation
- **Visual Effect**: Form container rotates slightly on focus with ambient lighting

## Multi-turn Interaction Flows

### Project Discovery Flow
1. User lands on homepage with 3D hero section
2. Scrolls to GitHub projects section
3. Uses filter dropdown to select specific technologies
4. Clicks on project card to see expanded details
5. Can navigate to dedicated projects page for full showcase
6. Each project links back to GitHub repository

### Skills Exploration Flow
1. User navigates to about page
2. Interacts with 3D skills visualization
3. Hovers over different skill categories
4. Clicks to see related projects and experience
5. Can filter skills by domain (frontend, backend, design)
6. Each skill node shows learning timeline and projects

### Contact Engagement Flow
1. User accesses contact page
2. Form fields respond to focus with 3D transformations
3. Real-time validation provides immediate feedback
4. Submit button shows loading state with particle effects
5. Success message appears with animated confirmation
6. Social links available with hover 3D tilt effects

## Technical Implementation Notes

- All interactions use modern JavaScript with smooth animations
- 3D effects implemented using Three.js and WebGL
- GitHub API calls cached for performance optimization
- Responsive design ensures interactions work on all devices
- Accessibility considerations for all interactive elements
- Progressive enhancement for users without WebGL support
